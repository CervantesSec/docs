## Introduction



Since technology has been flooding our lives, cybersecurity has become essential to protect our privacy and data. For this, Offensive Security or Pentesting has become one of the main parts in recent years and is increasingly taking more presence as a requirement in many security standards or regulations.

In the end, Ethical Hacking is nothing more than an "authorized and controlled" attack on one or more computer systems of a company. This process is performed to identify vulnerabilities, as well as strengths, which allows to complete a risk assessment, and there are practices for its realization, procedural and phased, that professionals in this discipline know perfectly well.

Of course, the organization of the pentesting information, the reporting process and the collaboration within a pentesting project is one of the fundamental and critical parts for the successful completion of a pentesting project. In the end all this leads to a report which is where we will represent our work, everything we have done for weeks and is the place where we will give all the information discovered, as well as the security recommendations to our client.

To organize and represent in a clear, concise and simple way all this information we need the help of a tool, which will help us to save time during the pentest, in the writing and elaboration of the report. And for this we have worked on the following project called Cervantes, which will allow us to share, organize all the information that is collected, and make the life and work of the pentester easier.
